//! Module aims to help formatting code.
//!
//! Module should help with such requests:
//! * `textDocument/formatting`
//! * `textDocument/rename`
//! * `textDocument/prepareRename`
//!
//! Also it might be good idea to handle such requests:
//! * `inlayHint/resolve`
//! * `textDocument/foldingRange`
//! * `textDocument/codeAction`
//! * `codeAction/resolve`
//! * `textDocument/rangeFormatting`
//! * `textDocument/onTypeFormatting`
//!
//! These methods are also about action, but there no need to implement them:
//! * `textDocument/codeLens`
//! * `codeLens/resolve`
//!
//!
