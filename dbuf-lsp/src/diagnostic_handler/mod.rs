//! Module provides colorful diagnostic.
//!
//! Module should help with such requests:
//! * `textDocument/diagnostic`
//!
//! Also it might be good idea to handle such requests:
//! * `workspace/diagnostic`
//! * `textDocument/documentSymbol`
//! * `textDocument/semanticTokens/full`
//! * `textDocument/semanticTokens/full/delta`
//! * `textDocument/semanticTokens/range`
//! * `textDocument/inlineValue`
//! * `textDocument/inlayHint`
//!
//! These methods are also about diagnostic, but there no need to implement them:
//! * `textDocument/documentColor`
//! * `textDocument/colorPresentation`
//!
//!
